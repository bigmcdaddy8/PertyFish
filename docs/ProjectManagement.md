## Project Goals
I started PertyFish because I wanted to learn how to create a canvas app and I usually find most tutorials that are business related boring and difficult for me to follow. I have the bad characteristic of learning the best if I find something interesting, and my method of learning is too follow bright shiny objects of new nuggets of interest that I believe might be helpful on my overall quest.  So in my attempt to learn how to create a canvas app I created a Chess application written entirely in PowerFx. It is intended that the chess program will contain a chess engine that a human can play against, this embedded chess engine would also be written entirely in PowerFx.
### Realizations
While creating this chess program, it became apparent to me that the embedded chess engine would be facing some limitations because creating a chess engine using Low Code is definitely a case of using the wrong tool for the job. My goal was not to produce a chess engine that could necessarily play at a high level, and exactly to what level is part of the continuing quest. Starting off with a chess program that contains a chess engine that simply makes random moves is the first step.
Creating a chess program that only allows legal moves and supports all of the tricky aspects of chess is a great start.
### Chess Tricky Parts
- Castling
- En Passant 
- Pawn promotions 

## Upcoming work
Using Agile development methodology terms (in a very rough and causal manner) here is what needs to be done on this project...
### Epic - Create a Chess Program as a Power Apps Canvas App using only PowerFx
#### Feature - Make the project publicly available 
Use Github to make the project and source code publicly available. The files and support documentation should mostly follow some best practice standards in this regard. As all of this is new to the project owner (PowerFx, Github, OSS) and this is the very first attempt at all the technical topics, strict adherence to any standard is not a requirement at this time because I do not want to commit to a direction that I don't understand, but would rather grow in a direction that makes sense to me and the project. Usually I find creating documentation boring (would rather write code), but the idea of a properly organized project and standard documentation does sounds intriguing and worthwhile.
##### Story - README
Create the outline for a respectable README, and then create stories for the work needed to create the major sections.
#### Feature - Learn how to play well with others
I have no idea if anybody in the universe has any interest in a project like this. And if they did I have no idea how to properly run an OSS project, so I and this project probably won't draw much is any interest, that's OK, I am doing this because I currently find the subjects (OSS Project Management and a Chess Program that is a Low Code Canvas App) involved in this project interesting.
