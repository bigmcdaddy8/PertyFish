# PertyFish - A Chess Game w/ built-in chess engine Power Apps Canvas App written entirely in PowerFx

This project is a Chess Game written entirely in PowerFx (the low code language using in Power Apps development). This project was created by the author as a fun way to learn how to create a Power App Canvas Application. The game supports human vs. human play, human vs. computer (the built in chess engine logic), and computer vs. computer (i.e., it can play against itself). The goal of the project is NOT to create a powerful chess game/engine, but rather to create one that works, is fully functional, and written entirely using low code. PertyFish only allows legal chess moves, including the tricky stuff like castling, en passant captures, and pawn promotions.

## Project Status

This is the author's first open source project and therefore the first attempt at managing an OSS project. At this time the author is the only contributor and is in the process of learning lots of new things Github related. Additional contributors are welcome however be warned that the author is new at all of this OSS, Github, and Power App technologies, so please be patient. The author works on this project as a hobby, and has generally adds code checks project status at least monthly (usually weekly).
